It's one of the common questions you'll face in a job interview as a software engineer. 

There are usually 3 options to answer this question:

1. You give a number
2. You give a range
3. You dodge the question

Let's cover each of these options in detail.

## Why This Question Is Dangerous

This question may sound innocent, but it's often used to **anchor** your future offer â€” possibly lower than what the company was already willing to pay.

If you answer too early:
- You might **undervalue yourself**.
- You lose the chance to negotiate with full context.
- You **limit your leverage**.

## What's the Best Strategy?

ðŸ‘‰ **Don't give a number**.  
ðŸ‘‰ **Don't even give a range (yet)**.  
Instead, **redirect the question politely**.

Here's a great way to respond:

> _"I'm open to discussing a fair offer based on the role, responsibilities, and the full compensation package. Could you share what the budgeted range is for this position?"_

Why this works:
- You show you're flexible.
- You ask them to reveal their range first.
- You keep room to negotiate later.

## When Should You Share a Number?

Once the employer gives you more information about:
- The exact responsibilities
- Benefits and perks
- Growth opportunities
- Work expectations

**Then** you can consider making a well-informed counteroffer.

## Summary

âœ… Don't reveal your number first  
âœ… Redirect the question  
âœ… Learn more about the role before negotiating  
âœ… Stay calm â€” this is normal!

ðŸ’¬ Still unsure? Try writing your own version of the redirection response and practice saying it out loud. Confidence matters!
