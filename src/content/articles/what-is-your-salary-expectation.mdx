It's one of the common questions you'll face in a job interview as a software engineer. 

There are usually 3 ways to answer this question:

1. Give a number
2. Give a range
3. Dodge the question

Let's cover each of these in detail.

## Give a number

This was how I usually answered this question: 

> I'm looking for X per month!

That was my go-to answer until I joined this mid-sized tech company.

I joined as a mid-level software engineer.
Later, I found out that other engineers on my team were getting paid more than I was. 

The interesting part ? 

- We were working on the same codebase.
- We had similar responsibilities.
- We were fixing the same bugs.
- They had no additional contributions to the project.
- They had the more or less same level of prior work experience as me.

I nailed the interview as well:
- I passed the technical round so well that they gave me positive feedback right after.
- I got the offer just a few hours after the final interview - yes, on the same day!
- They offered the exact salary I asked for. No negotiation. No pushback.

This was the issue: *I gave them the damn number.*

The number I asked for matched the salary of a mid-level engineer at the company.

Now, here’s the thing - I was a senior in my previous roles.
But since they gave me exactly what I asked for, I didn’t think too much about the “mid-level” title when I joined.

That’s when it hit me. If I had asked for more, I probably would’ve been hired at the senior level and paid accordingly.

This experience changed how I think about salary negotiation.
Especially how to answer this question.

Here’s the lesson I learned:

- Never give them the number!
