title: How to Answer “What Is Your Salary Expectation?
---
import ReactColorChanger from '../../components/ReactColorChanger.jsx';

It’s one of the trickiest and most important questions you’ll face in a job interview:

> “What is your salary expectation?”

Most candidates freeze here. Should you say a number? Give a range? Dodge the question?

Let’s start with you — **how do you normally answer it?**

## Why This Question Is Dangerous

This question may sound innocent, but it's often used to **anchor** your future offer — possibly lower than what the company was already willing to pay.

If you answer too early:
- You might **undervalue yourself**.
- You lose the chance to negotiate with full context.
- You **limit your leverage**.

---

## What's the Best Strategy?

👉 **Don't give a number**.  
👉 **Don't even give a range (yet)**.  
Instead, **redirect the question politely**.

Here’s a great way to respond:

> _“I'm open to discussing a fair offer based on the role, responsibilities, and the full compensation package. Could you share what the budgeted range is for this position?”_

Why this works:
- You show you're flexible.
- You ask them to reveal their range first.
- You keep room to negotiate later.

## When Should You Share a Number?

Once the employer gives you more information about:
- The exact responsibilities
- Benefits and perks
- Growth opportunities
- Work expectations

**Then** you can consider making a well-informed counteroffer.

## Summary

✅ Don’t reveal your number first  
✅ Redirect the question  
✅ Learn more about the role before negotiating  
✅ Stay calm — this is normal!

---

💬 Still unsure? Try writing your own version of the redirection response and practice saying it out loud. Confidence matters!
