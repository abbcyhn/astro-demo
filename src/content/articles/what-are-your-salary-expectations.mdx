It’s one of those interview questions usually asked at the start of the interview process. It seems innocent at first glance. 
However, it quietly shapes your entire offer.

There are really three ways to answer this question:

1. Give a number
2. Give a range
3. Deflect gracefully

Let me break each one down.

## Give a number (and why it's a bad idea)

This was my default answer early on:
> I’m targeting $X per month.

Simple, honest, and no fuss. I said it with confidence. Once, it even got me an offer within hours of the final interview.

But here’s the part that still makes me wince.

At that company, I joined as a mid-level engineer. 
Friendly team, decent tech stack, solid project. 
Everything seemed great.
Until I learned that a few of my teammates were being paid significantly more.
Doing literally the same work as me.

Same level. Same repo. Same velocity. Same responsibility.

It was not jealousy, exactly. I was not mad neither. But I felt cheated. I'd unknowingly shortchanged myself in some silent negotiation I didn't realize I was having.

I traced it back to that one moment. The recruiter had asked, “What are your salary expectations?” And I told the number.

And guess what? That’s exactly what they gave me.

I got the number I asked for. But not the number I deserved.

<CalloutTip title="Lesson learned: Never give a number upfront."> 
If you tell a number, here's what can happen:
- Too high? They quietly pass on you;
- Too low? They underpay you;
- Just right? You gave away all your leverage.
</CalloutTip>

## Give a range (and how it can work against you)

Some folks say, 

> Okay, I won’t give a single number. I’ll give a range!

To say range, you need to 
- done comprehensive market research;
- find out market rate for this exact role;
- guess the company's budget for this role.

Lets say you found the closest range for the role.
There is still a problem with this approach. 
Recruiters usually offer the lower end of a salary range.

For example, you say:

> I’m looking for something between $100K and $120K.

They hear:

> $100K sounds doable!

It also signals a willingness to compromise before they’ve even evaluated your value.


## Deflect gracefully (and why it's the best move)

Here’s where things get interesting. You can deflect the question without sounding weird.

Our main goal should not reveal a number or range, it should be to get the interviewer to share the salary range for the role.

But how ? 

Let me share a script I've used with success:

> You know, there are a lot of factors that can affect the salary at least for me. For example,
> * The people I am work with
> * The project I am working on
> * The tech stack I am working with 
> 
> Without knowing this, I don't want to give uneducated answer.
> However I believe that it is crucial for you to know answer to this question before we can move forward.
> I can help you with that if you share the salary range for the role.
> I can tell you if that works for me or not.
> So, we can decide to move forward or not.

See what that does? 
It puts the ball back in their court. 
It shows you are not desperate for the job and professional.
It earns time for you to show your value during the interview so when you reach the end you can get the number you deserve.

I recall myself when I started to using this script. 
It came to me by practice. So at the beginning I felt awkward and uncomfortable.
Probably you will feel the same. However for sake of your career, it is worth try it.

Additionally, using this script doesn't mean interviewer will share the salary range immediately.
They also have answer for this kind of scenarios.
So based on my experience, I share with you the game. 
So you can practice what can response interviewer can give you.



<CalloutTip title="Lesson learned: Never give a number upfront."> 
At the start of an interview process, they don’t know:
- your full story;
- your leadership skills;
- what you’ve shipped;
- regressions you prevented in code reviews;
- critical issues you fixed during midnight on-call shifts.

## 🎁 Bonus: How to handle online applications that *require* a number 
Ah yes, the infamous “Expected Salary” field in online applications.

You’ve got a few options here—and no, leaving it blank isn't always possible.

Try one of these:

Put “Negotiable.” Some systems accept it, some don’t—but it’s worth trying first.

Enter a broad range. Example: “100000–200000.” Yeah, it looks ridiculous. But if it buys you flexibility later, it’s worth it.

Enter the minimum you'd accept, plus wiggle room. Don’t go rock bottom—go realistic, then round up. E.g., if $120K is your true floor, put $130K.

<CalloutInfo title="Pro tip: Document every version of your application."> 
    Take screenshots or save PDFs. 
    That way, if you ever need to revisit what you submitted—or a recruiter references it—you’ve got receipts. 
</CalloutInfo>

## TL;DR (But With Feeling)
Don’t give a number too early. You’ll anchor low or scare them off.

Ranges are better than nothing—but still risky.

The best move? Deflect gracefully. Delay the number until they see your value.

When forced to enter a number? Make it broad, fair, and flexible.
