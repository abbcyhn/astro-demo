It's one of the common questions you'll face in a job interview as a software engineer. 

There are usually <ins>3 ways</ins> to answer this question:

1. Give a number
2. Give a range
3. Dodge the question

Let's cover each of these in detail.

## Give a number

This was how I usually answered this question: 

> I'm looking for X per month!

That was my go-to answer early in my career until I joined this mid-sized tech company.

I joined as a mid-level software engineer.
Later, I found out that some of engineers on my team were getting paid more than I was. 

The interesting part ? 

- They were mid-level, like me.
- They worked on the same codebase as me.
- They built similar features to mine.
- They fixed bugs like I did.
- They made no extra contributions to the project, just like me.
- Their prior experience was about the same as mine.

I wasn‚Äôt unhappy with my salary.
But I did feel underpaid.
Something had clearly gone wrong during the interview process.
But what exactly?

It wasn‚Äôt the interview itself because I nailed it:
- I passed the technical rounds with positive feedback.
- I got the offer a few hours after the final interview.
- They gave me the exact salary I asked.

You see ? 

<b>This was the issue: <ins><i>I gave them the damn number!</i></ins></b> 

That moment changed how I think about salary conversations.
Especially this one question:
‚ÄúWhat are your salary expectations?‚Äù

<CalloutTip title="Lesson learned: Never give a number!"> 
  At the beginning of the interview, they don‚Äôt know:
  - your skills
  - your accomplishments
  - (most importantly) your value
  
  If you throw out a number too early, a few things can happen:
  - You aim too high ‚Üí they pass on you.
  - You aim too low ‚Üí they underpay you.
  - You hit the middle ‚Üí they anchor low, and you have no leverage.
  - Or, like me, they give you exactly what you asked for‚Äîonly for you to later realize you were worth a lot more.
