Let‚Äôs talk about a tricky question.

> What are your salary expectations?

Seems simple, right? But it‚Äôs not.

This question shows up early in most interviews.
And how you answer can shape everything that comes next.

You‚Äôve got three choices:
1. Say a number
2. Say a range
3. Deflect kindly

Let‚Äôs walk through them.

## Say a Number (Seems Right But It's Not)

Early on my career, I always gave a number:

> I‚Äôm looking for $X per month.

It felt clear. 
I thought I was being honest.
And once, it got me an offer within hours of the final interview.

But later‚Ä¶ I found out something hard.

At that job, I was doing the same work as others:
- Same level. 
- Same repo. 
- Same velocity. 
- Same responsibility. 

But they got paid more than me. A lot more.

I wasn‚Äôt angry. Not really.
But I felt like I messed up.
I had accidentally sold myself short.

I traced it back to that one moment. 
When I told the recruiter my number.
So yes, I got the number I asked for but not the number I truly deserved.

{/* <SalarySliderGame client:load /> */}

<CalloutTip title="Lesson learned: Don‚Äôt give a number first."> 
Here‚Äôs what can happen if you do:
- Ask too much? They skip you.
- Ask too little? They lowball you.
- Ask ‚Äújust right‚Äù? You lost your leverage.
</CalloutTip>

## Say a Range (Still Risky)

Some people say,

> Okay then, I‚Äôll give a range!

Sounds better, right?
Not really.

To give a really good range, you need to:
- Know the market well
- Find out market rate for this exact role
- Guess their budget (yikes)

Even if you nail all that, here‚Äôs the problem:

They hear the low end of a range. Always! 

For example, you say:

> I‚Äôm looking for $100K to $120K.

They hear:

> $100K sounds doable!

See the issue? You showed your hand before they even saw your value.

They now know you're flexible (maybe too flexible).

## Deflect Kindly (Best Option)

So‚Ä¶ what do you do instead?

Here‚Äôs the real move: <ins>don‚Äôt answer directly.</ins>

Not with a number. Not with a range. Instead, guide the talk. Ask them for the range.

<CalloutSuccess title="Here's the script I use">
There are many things that affect what salary feels right to me. For example,
* the team - I'll work with
* the project - I'll be working on
* the tech stack - I'll be using
* the impact - I'll have on the company

I want to give a thoughtful answer, not an uneducated one.
I also know this is a crucial question for you to know before we can move forward.
If you share the salary range for this role,
I can tell you if that fits what I‚Äôm looking for.
</CalloutSuccess>


See what that does?
* It puts the question back on them.
* It shows you‚Äôre thoughtful not unsure.
* It buys you time to prove your worth.

<CalloutInfo title="Tip: Practice makes it more natural."> 
At first, I felt awkward saying it.
You probably will too.
That‚Äôs normal.

But once you practice, it gets easy, natural and powerful.
</CalloutInfo>

{/* TODO: Create a game for possible recruiter's response */}
Just know, sometimes they won‚Äôt give a range immediately.
That‚Äôs okay. It‚Äôs all part of the game.
The key is to try to get the range.

<CalloutTip title="Lesson learned: Don‚Äôt name your price before they know your value."> 
Let them see what you bring before money comes up. They don‚Äôt know yet:
* Your big wins
* Your leadership style
* What bugs you fixed at 2 AM
* What projects you carried over the finish line
</CalloutTip>

## üéÅ Bonus Tip: What If an Online Form Makes You Give a Number?
Ah yes, the classic ‚ÄúExpected Salary‚Äù box.

Here are a few tricks:
* If you can leave it empty, do it.
* If it accepts string, try ‚ÄúNegotiable.‚Äù 
* If it accepts range, enter a wide range. 
* If it accepts only number, give a slightly higher number than your bottom line.

{/* TODO: Rewrite the following */}
I know, I know... The last two tricks violate what I said earlier.
But if you want to be invited to the interview, you need to fill the form.
Once you get the confident with the script I shared with you, you can easily tell during the interview that I just filled the form to have a conversation.
To know the role, there was no option to skip the field so I filled it. And bring conversation to the learning the range.

Couple of experiences:
* Once I filled the box with "Negotiable" and I got the offer from the company.
* Once I filled the box with "Monthly or Yearly ?" and I got the offer from the company.
* Once I filled the box with 10000000 and I invited to the interview.

However there were times as well, I not called to the interview when I 
* filled form with random number or string. 

Again just fill forms in the way you feel comfortable. And you can tell during the interview that I just filled the form to have a conversation. 
Learn about the company and the role. Bla bla.

Again those also will comes with practice.

<CalloutTip title="Pro Tip: Save your responses."> 
    Take screenshots or save PDFs. 

    That way, if you ever need to revisit what you submitted or a recruiter references it you‚Äôve got receipts. 
</CalloutTip>

## TL;DR (But With Feeling)
Don‚Äôt give a number too early. You‚Äôll anchor low or scare them off.

Ranges are better than nothing‚Äîbut still risky.

The best move? Deflect gracefully. Delay the number until they see your value.

When forced to enter a number? Make it broad, fair, and flexible.
