ANALYZE: the image pasted 

OBJECTIVE
Extract a comprehensive and reusable design system from the image pasted, excluding any specific visual content, to create a JSON reference that developers or AI systems can use as a styling foundation for consistent UI development.

INSTRUCTIONS
Examine the image pasted to identify:
* Color schemes and palettes
* Font hierarchies and typography standards
* Spacing and margin conventions
* Structural layouts (grid systems, card designs, wrapper elements, etc.)
* Interactive elements (button styles, form inputs, data tables, etc.)
* Visual effects (corner rouding, drop shadows, and additional styling treatments)
Generate a design-system.json file that systematically documents these design principles and enables consustent visual language reproduction.
Save the JSON output as /designs/design.json
