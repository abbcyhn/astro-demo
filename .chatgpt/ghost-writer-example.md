# GIVEN ARTICLE
I know, I know... The last two tricks violate what I said earlier.
But if you want to be invited to the interview, you need to fill the form.
Once you get the confident with the script I shared with you, you can easily tell during the interview that I just filled the form to have a conversation.
To know the role, there was no option to skip the field so I filled it. And bring conversation to the learning the range.

Couple of experiences:
* Once I filled the box with "Negotiable" and I got the offer from the company.
* Once I filled the box with "Monthly or Yearly ?" and I got the offer from the company.
* Once I filled the box with 10000000 and I invited to the interview.

However there were times as well, I not called to the interview when I 
* filled form with random number or string. 

Again just fill forms in the way you feel comfortable. And you can tell during the interview that I just filled the form to have a conversation. 
Learn about the company and the role. Bla bla.

Again those also will comes with practice.
